# CPP-Creations
CPP-Creations, a repository dedicated to exploring the fundamentals and practical applications of C++ programming. This collection features a variety of projects, from basic algorithms to simple data structures and utility programs, aimed at helping beginners and intermediate developers enhance their C++ skills.


## Why C++?

C++ is a powerful language that builds on the foundation of C. It supports object-oriented programming, provides strong type checking, and includes the Standard Template Library (STL) for common data structures and algorithms. Learning C++ gives you a solid grounding in both low-level and high-level programming concepts.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to get a local copy of the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sadiasakharkar/CPP-Creations.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project**: Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CPP-Creations
   ```

3. **Explore the Code**: Browse the directories and files to find various programs and examples. Each project or algorithm is contained in its own file with a brief description of its functionality.

4. **Build and Run**: Depending on the program, you might need to compile it. Use the `g++` compiler to build C++ programs:
   ```bash
   g++ -o output_file_name source_file_name.cpp
   ```
   Replace `output_file_name` with your desired executable name and `source_file_name.cpp` with the file you want to compile. Then run the program:
   ```bash
   ./output_file_name
   ```

Happy coding, and may your journey in C++ be as rewarding as it is enlightening!
